# genshin-nextlevel-calculator
This tool can help you determine when you will reach a certain adventure level in Genshin Impact, based on an amount of EXP you earn per day.

However, keep in mind that the calculation can only take into account a fixed number of EXP gained per day (resin and dailies for example).

The final result will therefore not take into account the quests and exploration that you do, but it's still pretty cool to have a little estimate!
